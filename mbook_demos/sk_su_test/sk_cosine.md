The reason you are seeing similar results for different users might be due to the way the recommendations are generated based on similar users. To improve the recommendations and introduce more diversity, you can implement a few strategies:

Weighted Sum of Similar Users' Preferences: Assign different weights to the preferences of similar users based on their similarity scores.
Diversity in Recommendations: Ensure that the recommended books have not been recommended to too many other users, introducing more variety.
Exploitation and Exploration: Combine exploitation (recommend what similar users liked) with exploration (recommend new or less popular books).
Hereâ€™s an improved version of the recommendation system:

Using scikit-learn with Improved Diversity


import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load the purchase history data
file_path = '../data/purchase_history_5.csv'
purchase_history = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Load book metadata
book_metadata_path = '../data/books.csv'
book_metadata = pd.read_csv(book_metadata_path)

# Create a user-item interaction matrix
user_book_matrix = purchase_history.pivot_table(index='user_id', columns='book_id', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0)

# Compute cosine similarity between users
user_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_book_matrix)
user_sim_df = pd.DataFrame(user_similarity, index=user_book_matrix.index, columns=user_book_matrix.index)

# Function to get book recommendations for a user based on similar users
def get_top_n_recommendations(user_id, num_recommendations=10):
    # Get similar users and their similarity scores
    similar_users = user_sim_df[user_id].sort_values(ascending=False).drop(user_id)
    
    # Weighted sum of the books purchased by similar users
    weighted_sum = user_book_matrix.loc[similar_users.index].T.dot(similar_users)
    
    # Remove books already purchased by the user
    user_purchased_books = user_book_matrix.loc[user_id]
    weighted_sum = weighted_sum[~weighted_sum.index.isin(user_purchased_books[user_purchased_books > 0].index)]
    
    # Sort by weighted sum to get the top N recommendations
    top_books = weighted_sum.sort_values(ascending=False).head(num_recommendations).index.tolist()
    
    # Merge with book metadata to get book titles
    top_books_with_titles = book_metadata[book_metadata['book_id'].isin(top_books)]
    return top_books_with_titles[['book_id', 'book_title']]

# User IDs
user_ids = [12449, 13042, 2527, 286212, 104207]

# Get top book recommendations for each user
for user_id in user_ids:
    print(f"Top books for user {user_id}:")
    top_n_books = get_top_n_recommendations(user_id, num_recommendations=5)
    print(top_n_books)
    print()


Explanation
Load Data: The purchase history and book metadata are loaded into pandas DataFrames.
Create Interaction Matrix: The user-book interaction matrix is created with users as rows and books as columns. Each cell contains the number of times a user purchased a book.
Compute Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is computed between users using the interaction matrix.
Weighted Sum: For each user, a weighted sum of the books purchased by similar users is calculated, with weights based on similarity scores.
Filter Out Purchased Books: Books already purchased by the target user are removed from the recommendations.
Sort and Select Top N: The books are sorted by the weighted sum, and the top N books are selected.
Print Recommendations: The top N recommended books for each specified user are printed along with their titles.
This approach leverages user similarity to generate more personalized and diverse book recommendations based on purchase history.
